# "READ MY MESSAGE FOR EVERY FOR THE BEST TESTING EVER" 
# The Winter Soldier
We were once kids.
We were once wild.
We were once soldiers.
In the dead of winter you greeted death.
You fell from my grip and into his arms,
and now a hundred years have rotted away and I'm so alone.
I ran from the winter because war was to attached to it.
I close my eyes and I see you there on the front line.
Young and drained just a body rotting away.
Full of life you hung on but 
bang bang.
It was such an awful sound.
Only if I had taken your place.
If only you would had ran the other way.
Just how unfair is our luck.

Someday I'll teach myself to learn and live alone.
I'll teach myself that death wasn't the enemy.
But the winter storm rages on and I'm having trouble breathing.
Don't be alarmed. 
I march on.
Like the soldier I once was.
Don't be alarmed.
I've seen many winter storms 
and I have sadly survived them all.

Can't you see that I don't want to move on. 
Don't bring tomorrow because I can't take another.
My eyes are to fogged to see the light.
My minds to cluttered to think right.
I've tasted my own tears 
and faced all my fears.
So here I am.
Laying on the floor.
So here we are.
Together once more.
